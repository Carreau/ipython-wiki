== Summary ==

IpyKit is a standalone IPython (win32) executable, created with py2exe and as such works on machines without python (or where you just don't have time to mess with installation). It includes pyreadline for full tab completion and color support, as well as other IPython goodies. Just unzip and run ipython.exe to go.

You can customize IpyKit by editing the <code>ipy_user_conf.py</code> in <code>_ipython</code> directory. You can also add your own favourite executables to the <code>bin</code> directory, which will always be added as the last thing to PATH.

Some versions of IpyKit have smallish executables from UnxUtils installed in bin/, but you probably want to construct an IpyKit distribution with your favourite programs.
